Theory: The sun is alive 

Framing: Darwin’s theory of evolution for stars



------- BEGIN STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS -------

The main reason we can’t see it is because of the timescales 


The sun is both stable AND complex


DNA = spectrograph
Is there an algorithm that can cluster a pool of DNA based on lineage? 
Could we apply that same algorithm to spectrographs?



Possible to trace lineage


Atoms are memetic structures, not fundamental elements


All recurring structures in the universe are likely to be mimetic 



Fermi paradox is rediculous  



Stars are homeostatic 


Sun produces less heat per unit volume than the human body


Once a photon is emitted by the sun’s core, it takes at least 10,000 years to reach the surface. Meaning, there are complex internal dynamics inside the sun. Sun spots, weather, currents, field shifts, etc. The more we study the sun, the more we realize how complex of a system it really is.
