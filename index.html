                    The laws of nature are the same everywhere. That's called universalism and it is the most 
                    important (ongoing) realization in science. This theory proposes that Darwin's laws of evolution 
                    and selection are also universal throughout the observable universe—including our sun.

                    <p>
                        First we discovered that the Earth orbits the sun, not the other way around. Our local position is not special.

                    <h4>Universal Physics</h4>
                    <p>
                        Later on, Newton saw that famous falling apple and asked "does the moon also fall?". 
                        Our local physics is not special.

                    <p>
                        Now I posit that Darwin's laws of evolution and selection are also universal throughout 
                        the observable universe—including celestial bodies like our sun.

                    <h4>Historical Rejection</h4>
                    <p>
                        The idea that the sun is somehow alive was specifically rejected by the church as a form of paganism.

                    <h4>Parochialism</h4>
                    <p>
                        The church has generally pushed parochialism (the idea that our local frame of reference is special) 
                        for thousands of years.

                    <p>
                        Cosmic timescales are unthinkably large (although it's possible that in the early universe they used to be shorter).

                    <p>
                        We can't see very clearly into the sun, and we see even less clearly into other stars.

                    <h4>The Fermi Paradox</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Fermi paradox feels intuitively like parochialism. Perhaps we're looking for the wrong 
                        type of life in the wrong places.

                    <p>
                        Stars have a lifecycle including long periods of homeostasis, similar to biological organisms.

                    <p>
                        The sun produces less heat per unit volume than the human body—a counterintuitive fact that 
                        challenges our perception of stars as simply raging furnaces.

                    <p>
                        Once a photon is emitted by the sun's core, it takes at least 10,000 years to reach the surface. 
                        This reveals complex internal dynamics inside the sun: sunspots, weather, currents, field shifts, etc. 
                        The more we study the sun, the more we realize how complex of a system it really is.

                    <p>
                        In the school of Richard Dawkins, we are all "meme machines." In other words, we are vessels for 
                        structures of information, our DNA, to propagate. DNA isn't just our unique fingerprint; it is our 
                        essential being. The signature IS the organism.

                    <p>
                        In the same way, a star is its spectrum. The spectrograph isn't just a measurement of a star—it is 
                        the star's essential signature, its "DNA."

                <h3>A New Paradigm</h3>
                <p>
                    This theory invites us to reconsider our definition of life beyond carbon-based biochemistry. 
                    By viewing stars as systems capable of evolution through natural selection, we may finally 
                    break free from the last vestiges of parochialism and understand that life—in some form—may be 
                    a universal property of the cosmos.
