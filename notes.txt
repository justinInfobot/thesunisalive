Theory: The sun is alive 

Framing: Darwin’s theory of evolution for stars

By: Justin Harvey (justin@aivideo.com)



------- BEGIN STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS -------

The laws of nature are the same everywhere. That's called universalism and it is the most important (ongoing) realization in science. 

First we discovered that the Earth orbits the sun, not the other way around. Our local position is not special. 

Later on, Newton saw that famous falling apple and asked "does the moon also fall?". Our local physics is not special.

Now I posit that Darwin's laws of evolution and selection are also universal throughout the observable universe.


Now whats preventing us from seeing the obvious? 

- The idea that the sun is somehow alive was specifically rejected by the church as a form of paganism.
- The church has generally pushed parochialism (the idea that our local frame of reference is special) for thousands of years. 
- Cosmic timescales are unthinkably large (although its possible that in the early universe they used to be shorter). 
- We cant see very clearly into the sun, and we see even less clearly into other stars. 




So what led me down this path? Well over a period of a few years I was exposed to a constellation of ideas that made me think the sun was, if not alive, at least much more similar to human life than we generally recognize.
- The fermi paradox feels intuitively like parochialism.
- Stars have a lifecycle including long periods of homeostasis.
- The sun produces less heat per unit volume than the human body.
- Once a photon is emitted by the sun’s core, it takes at least 10,000 years to reach the surface. Meaning, there are complex internal dynamics inside the sun. Sun spots, weather, currents, field shifts, etc. The more we study the sun, the more we realize how complex of a system it really is. 


None of these things tell me that the sun is alive. But they widened my frame of reference. Thats when I found the lynchpin. 


I noticed that these two images were eerily similar: 

[ spectrograph of the sun ]
[ human genome ]


In the school of Richard Dawkins, we are all "meme machines". In other words we are vessels for structures of information, our DNA, to propagate.

DNA isnt just our unique fingerprint, it is our essential being. The signature IS the organism. 

In the same way, a star is its spectrum.

That was the theory at least. Then I needed to find supporting evidence that this signature was being propagated in a way that we recognize as life. 

Basically I wanted evidence for 4 key traits that I considered "life-like":
- selection
- mutation
- reproduction
- metabolism


Selection:
?


Mutation: 
- elements combine in the suns core


Reproduction: 
- heavy elements scatter in supernovae and lineage can be traced: https://phys.org/news/2018-04-stars-dna-interrogated-sun-lost.html






Take it even further (appendix):
Atoms are also memetic structures, not fundamental elements

ALL recurring structures in the universe are likely to be mimetic.
